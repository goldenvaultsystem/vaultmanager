&emsp;&emsp;Vault Manager, Your Data Security Guardian, Protect your important data with bank authentication token technology.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Vault files are created using advanced public-key encryption technology, making them as secure as a rock. The decryption key is stored in a hardware key (Golden Key), eliminating the need for manual password entry. You only need to insert the Golden Key, enter the PIN code, and perform a secondary physical touch confirmation to use the 2048-bit private key stored in the Golden Key for decryption. This provides an extremely high level of security. With the combination of vault files and the Golden Key, ordinary users can easily achieve the same level of data security as e-commerce platforms.<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Personal User Workflow:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;1. Purchase and prepare the Golden Key hardware (currently supports Canokey and Yubikey).<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;3. Use Vault Manager to write the vault certificate and private key to the key hardware.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Stage of Creating Vault Files:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;4. Use Vault Manager and the key to create a personal vault file and store important data in it, achieving public-key encryption for data security.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;5. Store the vault file locally, in the cloud, or securely transmit it to a remote location without worrying about leaks.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Stage of Using Vault Files: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;6.  When using the vault file, insert the key, enter the PIN code, and perform a secondary physical touch to open and use the important data in the vault file. <br>
